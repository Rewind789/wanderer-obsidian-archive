E.g. Zinc + HCl → Hydrogen gas\n\nSome examples of chemical properties\n\n- Burn\n- Tarnish\n- Rust\n- Decompose\n- React with other metals\n- Instability\n- Do acid/base reactions\n\nExamples of Chemical Changes:\n\n- Burning\n- Rusting\n- Tarnishing\n- Decomposing\n- Polymerization\n    - A chain that repeats itself and bonds as a chain.\n    - Paint/plastic is an example of a polymer\n\nIn a chemical change:\n\n- Reacting substances form new substances with different compositions and properties\n- A chemical reaction takes place\n- Old bonds are broken and new bonds are made between atoms. Atoms in the reactants are rearranged to form new substances\n- Produces 1+ new substances\n\nEvidence of chemical changes\n\n- Colour change\n- Odour change\n- Formation of precipitate\n- Gas is formed (bubbles)\n- Production of light\n- Production of removal/gain of heat\n\n---\n\nTypes of Chemical Reactions\n\n![Reactions](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyjus.com%2Fchemistry%2Ftypes-of-chemical-reactions%2F\u0026psig=AOvVaw1y3Fbv0hKELOtSmriKn_HQ\u0026ust=1689909863944000\u0026source=images\u0026cd=vfe\u0026opi=89978449\u0026ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCPDH3fuqnIADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)\n\n1. Synthesis reaction\n2. Decomposition reaction\n3. Single displacement reaction\n4. Double displacement reaction\n5. Combustion reaction\n6. Acid-base reaction/neutralisation\n\nPhysical Change\n\n- Does not change the substance in a chemical way, but changes the substance overall. E.g. dissolving something in water, crushing a can, breaking glass etc.\n- Change in shape, size, phase\n\nSynthesis reactions (combination) occurs when ************************************multiple reactants************************************ combine to form a ****************************single product****************************\n\nRusting is a synthesis reactions. Iron + water → rust\n\n- General equation (A + B → AB)\n- Can have 2+ reactants, but only one product\n\nDecomposition reaction\n\n- one reactant that splits into 2+ products\n- When a compound breaks down into smaller parts\n- AB → A + B\n\nCombustion reactions\n\n- Refers to the process where substance burns in presence of oxygen, giving off heat and light in the process\n- Oxygen is always required to combust a substance\n- Hydrocarbon combustion\n- CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nSingle displacement reaction\n\n- Form of substitution reaction\n- If a compound has 2 parts, a single displacement reaction is when one of those parts is swapped for a new part\n- A more reactive element moves a less reactive element in a compound\n- Use reactivity trends\n- Form\n    - A + BC → B + AC (where A is the metal)\n    - A + BC → C + BA (where A is the non-metal)\n\nPrecipitation Reactions (Double displacement reactions) are another substitution reaction. Here, a two-part compound reacts with another two-part compound. Both compounds break apart, then rearrange in a different order.\n\n- Precipitation: two solutions from ionic compounds. Formation of a solid from two solutions\n- Formula for double displacement: AB + CD → CB + AD\n\nIonic compound = metal + non-metal\n\n---\n\n****************************Acid Baes Reactions (neutralisation)**************************** The pH is a measure of how many hydrogen ions are in a solution. The lower the pH is, more hydrogen ions are there. The pH is logarithmic, e.g. pH4 is ten times more acidic than pH 5\n\n- Acid: pH \u003c 7\n- Base: pH \u003e 7\n- Neutralisation reactions are reactions in which acids and bases react together to form salt and water\n- A type of double displacement reactions\n- EQ:\n    - Acid + base → salt + water\n    - HX + MOH → MX + H2O (where X and M are elements)\n- Examples\n    - Sulfuric acid is used to neutralise calcium hydroxide","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T08:16:10.366479118Z","tags":[]},"/notes/year9notes":{"title":"Year 9 Notes","content":"\n### Here are my Year 9 Notes Archive\nBrowse through the Year of 2023 and the Year 9 Curriculum and materials.\n\n[Science](notes/year9/science-content.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T08:16:10.366479118Z","tags":[]},"/town/TheTown":{"title":"The Town","content":"\n### The Town\nAfter wandering around the whole world, I find myself in the Town.\n\nOther members of the town include:\n- [Shan-mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/)\n- [Donal Tony (The Merchant of Harzavad)](https://harzavad.github.io/the-merchant/)\n- [Edward (and his obsidian notes)](https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/)\n- [Ajay](https://rjdjcool3.github.io/baju-s/)\n- Uhhhhh there's more but i'll do them (eventually)","lastmodified":"2023-07-21T08:16:10.366479118Z","tags":[]}}
