This library is built on obsidian and uses quartz.\n\nHi, welcome to my vast inventory. Here in this labyrinth of scrolls and artifacts, each organised neatly, you find many different types of notes. Each and every one different and exquisite in their own way. Chemistry, physics, diaries. Enjoy your stay in this vast library. Don't get lost~\n\nMy inventory and libraries are currently in an establishment within [The Town](town/TheTown), an oasis, where I let my mind rest, and wander no further anymore.\n\nHere are my [notes](notes/notes), where you can find my vast inventory of library and scrolls.

E.g. Zinc + HCl → Hydrogen gas\n\nSome examples of chemical properties\n\n- Burn\n- Tarnish\n- Rust\n- Decompose\n- React with other metals\n- Instability\n- Do acid/base reactions\n\nExamples of Chemical Changes:\n\n- Burning\n- Rusting\n- Tarnishing\n- Decomposing\n- Polymerization\n    - A chain that repeats itself and bonds as a chain.\n    - Paint/plastic is an example of a polymer\n\nIn a chemical change:\n\n- Reacting substances form new substances with different compositions and properties\n- A chemical reaction takes place\n- Old bonds are broken and new bonds are made between atoms. Atoms in the reactants are rearranged to form new substances\n- Produces 1+ new substances\n\nEvidence of chemical changes\n\n- Colour change\n- Odour change\n- Formation of precipitate\n- Gas is formed (bubbles)\n- Production of light\n- Production of removal/gain of heat\n\n---\n\nTypes of Chemical Reactions\n\n![Reactions](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fbyjus.com%2Fchemistry%2Ftypes-of-chemical-reactions%2F\u0026psig=AOvVaw1y3Fbv0hKELOtSmriKn_HQ\u0026ust=1689909863944000\u0026source=images\u0026cd=vfe\u0026opi=89978449\u0026ved=0CBAQjRxqFwoTCPDH3fuqnIADFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE)\n\n1. Synthesis reaction\n2. Decomposition reaction\n3. Single displacement reaction\n4. Double displacement reaction\n5. Combustion reaction\n6. Acid-base reaction/neutralisation\n\nPhysical Change\n\n- Does not change the substance in a chemical way, but changes the substance overall. E.g. dissolving something in water, crushing a can, breaking glass etc.\n- Change in shape, size, phase\n\nSynthesis reactions (combination) occurs when ************************************multiple reactants************************************ combine to form a ****************************single product****************************\n\nRusting is a synthesis reactions. Iron + water → rust\n\n- General equation (A + B → AB)\n- Can have 2+ reactants, but only one product\n\nDecomposition reaction\n\n- one reactant that splits into 2+ products\n- When a compound breaks down into smaller parts\n- AB → A + B\n\nCombustion reactions\n\n- Refers to the process where substance burns in presence of oxygen, giving off heat and light in the process\n- Oxygen is always required to combust a substance\n- Hydrocarbon combustion\n- CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nSingle displacement reaction\n\n- Form of substitution reaction\n- If a compound has 2 parts, a single displacement reaction is when one of those parts is swapped for a new part\n- A more reactive element moves a less reactive element in a compound\n- Use reactivity trends\n- Form\n    - A + BC → B + AC (where A is the metal)\n    - A + BC → C + BA (where A is the non-metal)\n\nPrecipitation Reactions (Double displacement reactions) are another substitution reaction. Here, a two-part compound reacts with another two-part compound. Both compounds break apart, then rearrange in a different order.\n\n- Precipitation: two solutions from ionic compounds. Formation of a solid from two solutions\n- Formula for double displacement: AB + CD → CB + AD\n\nIonic compound = metal + non-metal\n\n---\n\n****************************Acid Baes Reactions (neutralisation)**************************** The pH is a measure of how many hydrogen ions are in a solution. The lower the pH is, more hydrogen ions are there. The pH is logarithmic, e.g. pH4 is ten times more acidic than pH 5\n\n- Acid: pH \u003c 7\n- Base: pH \u003e 7\n- Neutralisation reactions are reactions in which acids and bases react together to form salt and water\n- A type of double displacement reactions\n- EQ:\n    - Acid + base → salt + water\n    - HX + MOH → MX + H2O (where X and M are elements)\n- Examples\n    - Sulfuric acid is used to neutralise calcium hydroxide","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T03:45:16.417823555Z","tags":[]},"/notes/year9notes":{"title":"Year 9 Notes","content":"\n### Here are my Year 9 Notes Archive\nBrowse through the Year of 2023 and the Year 9 Curriculum and materials.\n\n[Science](notes/year9/science-content.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T03:45:16.417823555Z","tags":[]},"/town/TheTown":{"title":"The Town","content":"\n### The Town\nAfter wandering around the whole world, I find myself in the Town.\n\nOther members of the town include:\n- [Shan-mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/)\n- [Donal Tony (The Merchant of Harzavad)](https://harzavad.github.io/the-merchant/)\n- [Edward (and his obsidian notes)](https://edsobsidiannotes.netlify.app/)\n- [Ajay](https://rjdjcool3.github.io/baju-s/)\n- Uhhhhh there's more but i'll do them (eventually)","lastmodified":"2023-07-20T03:45:16.417823555Z","tags":[]}}
