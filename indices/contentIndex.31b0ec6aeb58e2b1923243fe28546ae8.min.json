Synthesis reaction\n2. Decomposition reaction\n3. Single displacement reaction\n4. Double displacement reaction\n5. Combustion reaction\n6. Acid-base reaction/neutralisation\n\nPhysical Change\n\n- Does not change the substance in a chemical way, but changes the substance overall. E.g. dissolving something in water, crushing a can, breaking glass etc.\n- Change in shape, size, phase\n\nSynthesis reactions (combination) occurs when ************************************multiple reactants************************************ combine to form a ****************************single product****************************\n\nRusting is a synthesis reactions. Iron + water → rust\n\n- General equation (A + B → AB)\n- Can have 2+ reactants, but only one product\n\nDecomposition reaction\n\n- one reactant that splits into 2+ products\n- When a compound breaks down into smaller parts\n- AB → A + B\n\nCombustion reactions\n\n- Refers to the process where substance burns in presence of oxygen, giving off heat and light in the process\n- Oxygen is always required to combust a substance\n- Hydrocarbon combustion\n- CxHy + O2 → CO2 + H2O\n\nSingle displacement reaction\n\n- Form of substitution reaction\n- If a compound has 2 parts, a single displacement reaction is when one of those parts is swapped for a new part\n- A more reactive element moves a less reactive element in a compound\n- Use reactivity trends\n- Form\n    - A + BC → B + AC (where A is the metal)\n    - A + BC → C + BA (where A is the non-metal)\n\nPrecipitation Reactions (Double displacement reactions) are another substitution reaction. Here, a two-part compound reacts with another two-part compound. Both compounds break apart, then rearrange in a different order.\n\n- Precipitation: two solutions from ionic compounds. Formation of a solid from two solutions\n- Formula for double displacement: AB + CD → CB + AD\n\nIonic compound = metal + non-metal\n\n---\n\n****************************Acid Baes Reactions (neutralisation)**************************** The pH is a measure of how many hydrogen ions are in a solution.
