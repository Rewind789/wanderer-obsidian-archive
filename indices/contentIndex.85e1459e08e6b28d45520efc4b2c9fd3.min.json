In たりたり form, it suggests that you are not listing everything. In たりたり form, it suggests that you don't know which order they did the activities in.\n\nTo conjugate たりたり form, we replace the て at the end of our て-form of the verb with たり (this wording is confusing isn't it...)\n\nE.g. 行って --\u003e 行ったり\n- However, if the て form ends in で, use だり\nE.g. あそんだり --\u003e あそんだり\n\nAfter you list the verbs out, you add します which can be conjugated to show the nature of the whole phrase (e.g. past tense, plain form etc.) So します would be present/future tense to the whole phrase, while した would be a plain past tense.\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-26T13:03:04.491677756Z","tags":[]},"/notes/year10/japanese/japanese":{"title":"Japanese","content":"\nWell, I accelerated Japanese, so my year 10 notes are here a year earlier ig\n\n\u003e[!Examples] Content\n\u003e\n\u003e[Vocabulary \u0026 Grammar](vocabulary.md)\n\u003e\n\u003e[Text Structures](textstructures.md)\n\nAsk me for flashcards, my email is [ky.yuen2009@gmail.com](ky.yuen2009@gmail.com).
