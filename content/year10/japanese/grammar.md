##### ～たり　～たり
Just like て form, たりたり form is also used to verbs. 

> [!notes] て-form vs ～たりたり
> 
> て form is used to show sequential activities, however, たりたり does not. たりたり is also similar to や, as when the particle と is used, it suggests everything that you did, while や implies that you are not listing everything. In たりたり form, it suggests that you are not listing everything. In たりたり form, it suggests that you don't know which order they did the activities in.

To conjugate たりたり form, we replace the て at the end of our て-form of the verb with たり (this wording is confusing isn't it...)

E.g. 行って --> 行ったり
- However, if the て form ends in で, use だり
E.g. あそんだり --> あそんだり

After you list the verbs out, you add します which can be conjugated to show the nature of the whole phrase (e.g. past tense, plain form etc.) So します would be present/future tense to the whole phrase, while した would be a plain past tense.
