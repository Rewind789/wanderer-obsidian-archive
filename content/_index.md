Welcome to the Wanderer's Archive! Browse around the endless library of scrolls!

This library building is credited to [Jacky Zhao](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), who practically built the entire library you see before you! This library is built on obsidian and uses quartz.

1. Extremely fast natural-language [[notes/search]]
2. Customizable and hackable design based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
3. Automatically generated backlinks, link previews, and local graph
4. Built-in [[notes/CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï) | CJK + Latex Support]] and [[notes/callouts | Admonition-style callouts]]
5. Support for both Markdown Links and Wikilinks

Check out some of the [amazing gardens that community members](notes/showcase.md) have published with Quartz or read about [why I made Quartz](notes/philosophy.md) to begin with.


Returning user? Figure out how to [[notes/updating|update]] your existing Quartz garden.

If you prefer browsing the contents of this site through a list instead of a graph, you see a list of all [setup-related notes](/tags/setup).
