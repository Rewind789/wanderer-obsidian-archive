_[A page of his diary, of his adventures to every place on Earth. With every experience he ever had, written all in pen and paper. Within the vast libraries, many secrets still remain unseen...]_
Welcome to the Wanderer's Archive! Browse around the endless library of scrolls!

>[!info] Creation
This library building is credited to [Jacky Zhao](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), who practically built the entire library you see before you! This library is built on obsidian and uses quartz.

Hi, welcome to my vast inventory. Here in this labyrinth of scrolls and artifacts, each organised neatly, you find many different types of notes. Each and every one different and exquisite in their own way. Chemistry, physics, diaries. Enjoy your stay in this vast library. Don't get lost~

My inventory and libraries are currently in an establishment withinÂ [The Town](town/TheTown), an oasis, where I let my mind rest, and wander no further anymore.

Here are my [notes](notes/notes), where you can find my vast inventory of library and scrolls. Don't forget to check my [inventory](https://www.notion.so/wanderer-inventory/Wanderer-s-Archive-551bf6d3382148678191175b1123296f?pvs=4), where my notes are carefully stored.
