Atoms vs Molecules

- Elements can exist as either single atoms or as molecules
- A molecule consists of two or more atoms chemically joined together. The number of atoms in a molecule varies from substance to substance

Elements vs compounds

- If more than one type of atom is chemically combined, it is a compound
- Chemical bond
    - Atoms like to have full valence shells
    - They become more stable
    - Metals - metallic bond
    - Metal and non-metal - ionic bond
    - Two non-metals - covalent bond

Ionic bond

- Bonds between metals and non-metals
- Ionic bond (transfer)
    - Share electrons - balancing the equation

Ions

- Positive ions; lose proton —> cation
- The number of electrons lost is the amount of positive charge
- Write charge in superscript (small)
- Negative ions; gain proton —> anion

Naming

- Ionic bonds → called -ide
- The metal/positive ion is named first, keeps its normal name
- Negative ion is named second, changes to -ide
- In polyatomic compounds, it can be ide, ite or ate

Metal ions with several valency numbers

- Ag always 1+
- Zn always 2+
- Cu can be 1+ or 2+
- Write
    - Copper (__)
    - The roman numeral refers to the valency of the ion

Rules for covalent bonds

- Prefixes
    - 1- mono (2nd one)
    - 2 - di
    - 3 -tri
    - 4 - tetra
    - 5 - penta

Balancing equations

- Law of conservation of mass
    - In all chemical reactions, the number of each element involved must remain constant
    - Total mass of reactants = total mass of products
- Balance metals, then non-metals. Then nitrogen, hydrogen and lastly oxygen.
