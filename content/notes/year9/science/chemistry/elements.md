98 naturally occurring elements
Only 12 elements are found in living organisms in substantial amounts
Four elements make up to 96.3% of human weight → carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen
98% of atoms are either hydrogen or helium

**Isotopes**
An atom that has more or fewer neutrons in its nucleus
Affects the mass
When electron number changes we get -ions
- Electron gain → negative ion → anion
- Electron loss → positive ion → cation

**Electrons**
- When atoms bump into each other, electrons can be traded or shared
- Spin in shells around the nucleus
- Number of electrons per shell = 2n^2
3 has 8 for now

**Valency**
Ability an atom or a group of chemically bonded atoms to form chemical bonds with other groups of atoms
- The valence electrons are involved in bonding
- Atoms will trade/share electrons to gain full outer valency shells
- Metals and non-metals → ionic bond
- Two non-metals → covalent bond, they share electrons

**Practice**
Calcium + sulphate → K2SO4
Potassium + sulphate → CaSO4
Sodium hydroxide → NaOH
calcium carbonate → CaCO3
