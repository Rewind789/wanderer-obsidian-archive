# Atom Structure


Diatomic elements

- Br2, I2, N2, Cl2, H2, O2, F2 → only in pairs or in compounds. They are never found alone.
- Fusion and Fission

Atoms

- Matter - any substance that occupies space and has mass (weight)
- All matter is made up of atoms
- Atoms - smallest part that a substance can be broken down into ‘naturally’
- Everything we see around us everyday is made of atoms
- The diameter of an atom is about _____________m

Atomic structure

- Different types of atoms can combine to form new substances
- 118 known types of atoms, but only 98 of these are found naturally (synthetic → fake)
- Nucleus
    - Protons
        - Positively charged
    - Neutrons have approximately the same mass as protons
        - No charge but contribute to the mass of the atom
    - 1800x heavier than electrons
    - Electrons
        - Spin around in the space surrounding nucleus
        - Negatively charged
    - Positives and negatives attract, keeps electrons near nucleus
    - Atoms are neutral
        - No. of protons# = No. of electrons#
- Shells
    - 1st shell - 2 electrons
    - 2nd shell - 8 electrons
    - 3rd - 8 electrons
    - Can tell the number of shells → the rows/periods
    - Full outer shells → noble gasses. They do not bond with any element

### Elements
Elements

- Made of atoms with same number of protons in nucleus
- Same chemical properties
- ****Proton**** number determines the element
- Proton number = atomic number.
- Made of 1 type of atom (same proton)

Atomic Numbers

- Number of protons
- Correlates to the position on periodic table

Atomic mass number

- Roughly the number of protons + neutrons
- Each proton and neutron have an atomic mass of 1.67*10^-24 grans, defined as 1 atomic mass unit (amu)
