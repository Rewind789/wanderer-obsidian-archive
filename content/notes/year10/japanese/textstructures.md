Text Structures to know...

### Account Writing
An account is a personal experience (sort of like an article).
字 count is around ~350
2-3 points of what to include (usually 1 per paragraph)
Use polite form (です/ます)
Use feelings or opinions (adjectives/好き etc.)

> [!warning] MUST BE IN SEQUENTIAL ORDER. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE NIGHT THEN ABOUT THE MORNING.


> [!notes] Paragraph
> 
> Yes, they did it. They made Japanese into English. Now every time we write a paragraph we need to use TEEL structure (past-trauma from year 5). For the paragraph, give more detail on 1 thing than just give a big list without much information
> 
> Anyway...
> T: Topic Sentence -> this should usually be a short sentence that introduces what you are talking about. Give an idea to the reader what you want to talk about.
> E: Explanation -> explain what you are talking about, and what you did. Give context, and what you liked, found fun and etc. 
> E: Example -> give examples of what you did (wow) and what you liked best, what you found interesting
> L: Link -> link it to your point, give highlights and what you found most enjoyable

Introduction:
1. Give context on what you are doing. Do this by using the structure:
[Topic]について書きます -> I will write about [topic]

Conclusion:
1. とにかく, __
	- This means "in conclusion"
2. ませんか - this is used to engage the reader. 
	- e.g. こんど、あなたと行きませんか to ask the reader if they want to go together next time (its cringe but still you get marks. The school tells you to use it)
