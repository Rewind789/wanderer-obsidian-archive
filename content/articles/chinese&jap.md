### My Chinese and Japanese History

So there are actually languages other than English (wow ikr), and I wanted to do Japanese for ATAR, so I did Japanese. 
And then because I'm smart decided that doing Chinese Background (yes I'm Chinese...but I speak Cantonese and my Chinese skills are literally non-existent) so... after a lot of work I finally was prepared to go to Chinese Background Classes.
It was fun.

But then.... half a term later, I accelerated Japanese, and had to drop Chinese.
Wow, ik, an inspiring article.
