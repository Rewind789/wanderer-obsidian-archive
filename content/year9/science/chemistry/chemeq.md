# Chemical Equations
States in the chemical equations:

- Aqueous (aq)
- Solids (s) → reacting metals are usually solids **or** in precipitation reactions
- Liquids (l) → nearly all the liquids you see are mostly water
- Gas (g) → if the question states that the ‘gas’ is added. It is not implied that you should know if it is a gas (the question will tell you)

Making observations

- Observations are:
    - Information gathered by the senses
    - Qualitative observations - describe what you observe (don’t explain)
        - See e.g. colour change, gas/precipitation, clump forms, cloudy etc.
        - Bubbles/smoke
        - Smell
        - Feel e.g. hot or cold
    - Quantitative observations - exact measurements etc.

Data sheet

- Coloured ions in aqueous solution
- Determine if your compound can dissolve in solution (solubility tables)
- If you see if the ions are in the list provided, the colours shown for the ions is the colour you will observe
- If the ions are not on the list then assume they are colourless
- Solids formed by ions (ionic compounds) generally take the colour of the ions in solution unless they appear in the ionic solid list - **********white**********
- Metals
    - The colour of most metals is grey except copper and gold

Terminology

- Consumed (insoluble)
- Dissolved (soluble)
- Solutions are always clear (solution + mixture)
