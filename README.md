# Hi!
I am the Wanderer, and this is my archive. 
Huge thank you to Jacky Zhao, who practically made the whole thing, with the quartz.
Also thanks to EddietheEd and Nottaro for helping me set up this website.

My notes are either on paper/notion, so I copy them over...which takes time. So not all my notes are instantly here.
